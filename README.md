# SpotifyFlask: Music Recommendation Tool

Personal code for [RawcOn](https://rawcon.rawcsav.com/). 
Utilize the Spotify API to offer personalized music recommendations, insights into listening habits, playlist exploration + utilities, and whatever else I happen to think of.

## ⚠️ Important Notice: Spotify API Changes
As of November 27, 2024, Spotify has restricted access to several key Web API endpoints for new applications. These changes affect critical features including:
- Recommendations
- Audio Features/Analysis
- Related Artists
- Featured & Category Playlists
- Algorithmic and Editorial Playlists
- 30-second Preview URLs

**Current Status:** An extension request was submitted on 11/24, prior to these changes. If approved, the application will retain access to these endpoints. However, if the extension is not granted, significant portions of the application's functionality may become unavailable.

To use the development version of the application, contact me with your name and the email attached to your Spotify account.

> Note: The availability of certain features will depend on the outcome of the pending extension request and Spotify's API access policies.
