        <h3>1. Platform Integration & Service</h3>
        <p>
          Rawc-On is an advanced music analytics platform that integrates with
          the Spotify Platform. This application is bound by Spotify's Developer
          Terms and Developer Policy. The application is for personal,
          non-commercial use only and requires a Spotify Premium account for
          streaming functionality. Rawc-On bears sole responsibility for this
          service and its operation.
        </p>

        <h3>2. User Data & Privacy</h3>
        <p>
          We respect user privacy and only collect necessary data to provide our
          service. You can disconnect your Spotify account at any time by
          e-mailing me with a deletion request:
          <span class="email">gavin@rawcsav.com</span>. Upon e-mailing, all your
          data will be permanently deleted within 5 days. Otherwise, your data
          is retained for 30 days after your last activity, after which it is
          automatically deleted.
